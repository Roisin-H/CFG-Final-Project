            <h3>Bio:</h3>
            <p>Katherine was an American mathematician, described as “one of the most admired and inspirational people ever associated with NASA”. During her time working at NASA, Katherine was responsible for manually calculating and analysing flight paths and launch windows for various spaceflights and space programs - this was completed with little technology and recognition. Katherine was also involved in pioneering the use of computers to perform these tasks. </p>

            <h3>Main Achievements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Katherine was one of the first African-American women to work as a NASA scientist</li>
                <li>Katherine made significant contributions to space exploration - in interviews she highlighted her greatest contribution as the calculations that helped synch Project Apollo’s Lunar Module with the lunar-orbiting Command and Service Module</li>
                <li>Katherine was involved in many important space missions and programs, including John Glenn’s Friendship 7 mission and worked on the Space Shuttle and the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS, later renamed Landsat)</li>
                <li>Katherine authored/coauthored 26 research reports</li>
                <li>She co-authored one of the first textbooks on space whilst working at NASA</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Katherine was honoured with an array of awards for her groundbreaking work, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mathematician of the year in 1997 </li>
                <li>Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015</li>
                <li>NASA Group Achievement Award in 2016</li>
                <li>Congressional Gold Medal in 2019</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Why we love her:</h3>
            <p>Katherine was passionate about her education and career, and showed strength and assertiveness in a field where she was classed as the minority. Katherine was rejected from NASA the first time she applied but pursued her ambitions and reapplied the following year where she was successful. Through her tenacity, Katherine was the first woman in her division to receive credit as an author of a research report. She went on to achieve many more remarkable outcomes and was highlighted as being instrumental to the early success of NASA. </p>
