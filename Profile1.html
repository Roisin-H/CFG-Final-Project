  <h3>Why we love her</h3>
  <p>Annie Easley is not only a woman, but she is a black woman. She succeeded and made a name for herself in the aeronautics field, despite facing the racism, segregation, and discrimination prevalent in USA before and during the Civil Rights Movement. She is a huge inspiration to women and people of colour worldwide, inspiring us to keep going after our goals, even if it feels like the whole world is against us.</p>
